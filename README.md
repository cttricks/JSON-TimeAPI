# JSON-TimeAPI
**This time API is a simple "microservice" web service which returns the local-time for a given timezone in JSON. Some additional information is provided, such as whether that timezone is currently in Daylight Savings Time, when DST starts and ends, the UTC offset, etc.**

---

The API also exposes endpoints to obtain this information by translating an IP to a timezone. This can be done either for the IP of the system making the request, or for an explicitly provided IP address. Currently, this lookup is IPv4 only, uses freely available GeoIP databases, and is provided on a "best effort" basis -- errors and omissions may occur.
